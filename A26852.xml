         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And albeit we have an high and honorable esteem of those Godly and Learned Bishops, and others, who were the first Compilers of the Publick Liturgy, and do look upon it as an excellent and worthy Work, for that time, when the Church of <hi>England</hi> made her first step out of such a mist of Popish Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Superstition, wherein it formerly was involved; yet considering, that all Humane Works do gradually arrive at their maturity and perfection, and this in particular being a Work of that nature, hath already admitted several emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations since the first compiling thereof, It cannot be thought any disparagement, or derogation either to the Work it self, or to the Compilers of it, or to those who have hitherto used it, if after more than one hundred years since its first compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure such further emendations be now made therein, as may be judged necessary for satisfying the scruples of a multitude of sober persons, who cannot at all (or very hardly) comply with the use of it as now it is, and may best suit with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent times, after so long an enjoyment of the glorious light of the Gospel, and so happy a Reformation, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that many godly and learned men, have from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning all along earnesty desired the alteration of many things therein, and very many of His Majesty's pious peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and loyal Subjects, after so long a discontinuance of it, are more averse from it than heretofore; the satisfying of whom (as far as may be) will very much conduce to that Peace and unity which is so much desired by all good men, and so much endeavoured by His most excellent Majesty.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in pursuance of this His Majesty's most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Commission for the satisfying of tender Consciences, and the procuring of Peace and Unity amongst our selves, we judge meet to propose,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That all the Prayers, and other Materials of the Liturgy, may consist of nothing doubtfull or questioned amongst Pious, Learned and Orthodox Persons, inasmuch as the professed end of composing them is, for the declaring of Unity and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39600:6"/> consent of all who joyn in the Publick Worship, it being too evident, that the limiting Church-Communion to things of doubtfull disputation, hath been in all Ages the ground of Schism and separation, according to the saying of a Learned man.</p>
                  <p>To load our Publick Forms with the private Fancies upon which we differ, is the most Sovereign way to perpetuate Schism to the Worlds end. Prayer, Confession, Thanksgiving, reading of the Scriptures, and administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the plainest and simplest manner were matter enough to furnish out a suffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent Liturgy, though nothing either of private Opinion, or of Church pomp, of Garments, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Gestures, of Imagery, of Musick, of matter concerning the dead, of many superfluities which creep into the Church under the name of Order and Decency did interpose it self. To charge Churches or Liturgies with things unnecessary was the first beginning of all Superstition; and when scruple of Conscience began to be made, or pretended, then Schism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to break in. If the special Guides and Fathers of the Church would be a little sparing of incumbring Churches with Superfluities, or not over-rigid, either in reviving obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete Customs, or imposing new, there would be far lesse cause of Schism, or Superstition, and all the Inconvenience were likely to ensue would be but this; they should in so doing yield a little to the imbecility of their Inferiours, a thing which S. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have refused to do, mean while, wheresoever false or suspected Opinions are made a piece of Church-Liturgy, he that separates is not the Schismatick; For, it is alike unlawfull to make profession of known or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected falshood, as to put in practice unlawfull or suspected actions.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Further, we humbly desire, that it may be seriously considered, that as our first Reformers out of their great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did at that time so compose the Liturgy as to win upon the Papists, and to draw them into their Church-Communion, by varying as little as well they could from the Romish forms before in use; so whether in the present constitution and state of things amongst us we should not according to the same Rule of Prudence and Charity have our Liturgy so composed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39600:7"/> as to gain upon the judgement and affections of all those who in the substantials of the Protestant Religion are of the same perswasions with our selves. In as much as a more firm union and consent of all such, as well in Worship as in Doctrine, would greatly strengthen the Protestant Interest against all those dangers and temptations which our intestine Divisions and Animosities do expose us unto from the common Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>

                  <p n="5">V.

                  <p n="9">IX. That in as much as the Holy Scriptures are able to make us wise unto salvation to furnish us thoroughly unto all good works, and contain in them all things necessary either in Doctrine to be beleeved, or in Duty to be practised; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as divers Chapters of the Apocryphal Books appointed to be read, are charged to be in both respects of dubious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain credit: It is therefore desired that nothing be read in the Church for Lessons, but the Holy Scriptures in the Old and New Testament.</p>

                     <item>5. The Catechism is defective as to many necessary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our Religion, some even of the Essentials of Christianity not mentioned, except in the Creed, and there not so explicite as ought to be in a Catechism.</item>

That none may receive the Lord's Supper that dares not kneel in the act of receiving, but the Minister must exclude all such from the Communion, although such kneeling not only differs from the Practice of Christ and of his Apostles, but (at least on the Lords daies) is contrary to the practice of the Catholick Church for many hundred years after, and forbid by the most venerable Councils that ever were in the Christian world.

                  <p>The rather because these Ceremonies have for above an hundred years been the Fountain of manifold evils in this Church and Nation, occasioning sad Divisions between Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Ministers, and also between Ministers and People, exposing many orthodox, pious, and peaceable Ministers to the displeasure of their Rulers, casting them upon the Edge of the Penal Statutes, to the loss not only of their Livings and Liberties, but also of their opportunities for the service of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39600:10"/> Christ and his Church, and forcing people either to worship God in such a manner as their own consciences condemn, or doubt of, or else to forsake our Assemblies, as thousands have done, and no better fruits than these can be lookt for from the retaining and imposing these Ceremonies, unless we could presume that all his Majesties Subjects should have the same subtilty of Judgement to discern even to a Ceremony how farr the Power of man extends in the things of God, which is not to be expected, or should yeeld obedience to all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of men concerning them, without enquiring into the will of God, which is not to be desired.</p>

                  <p>We know much hath been spoken and written by way of Apology in answer to many things that have been objected, but yet the doubts and scruples of tender consciences still continue, or rather are increased: We do therefore humbly conceive it therefore a Work worthy of those Wonders of Salvation which God hath wrought for His Majesty, now on the Throne, and for the whole Kingdome, and exceedingly becoming the Ministers of the Gospel of Peace, with all holy moderation and tenderness to endeavour the removal of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing out of the Worship of God, which may justly offend or grieve the spirits of sober and godly people; the things themselves that we desire to be removed, not being of the foundation of Religion, nor the Essentials of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, nor the removal of them any way, tending to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Church or State; therefore their continuance and rigorous Imposition can no ways be able to countervail the laying aside of so many pious and able Ministers, and the unconceivable grief that will arise to multitudes of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties most Loyal and peaceable Subjects, who upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are ready ro serve him with their Prayers, Estates, and Lives: For the preventing of which evils, we humbly desire that these particulars following may be taken into serious and tender consideration.</p>

                  <p>By this Rubrick, and other places in the Common Prayer Book the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> is appointed to be said six times ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in every Morning and Evening Services, frequently eight times in a Morning, sometimes ten, which we think carries with it at least an appearance of that vain repetition which Christ forbids, for the avoyding of which appearance of evil; we desire it may be used but once in the Morning, and once in the Evening.</p>

                     <hi>Except.</hi> The Lessons, and the Epistles, and Gospels, being for the most part neither Psalms nor Hymns; we know no warrant why they should be sung in any place, and conceive that the distinct reading of them with an audible voyce, tends more to the edification of the Church: We desire that some Psalm or Scripture Hymn may be appointed instead of that Apocryphal.</p>

And if the Lord shall graciously please to give his blessing to these our endeavours, we doubt not but that the peace of this Church will be shortly setled, The hearts of Ministers and People comforted and composed, and the great mercy of Unitie and Stabilitie (to the immortall honour of our most dear Soveraign) bestowed upon us, and our poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity after us.</p>

And even in one of your Concessions in which we suppose you intend to accommodate with us, you rather widen then heal the Breach, for in your last <hi>Rubr.</hi> before the <hi>Catech.</hi> you would have the words thus altered, <hi>That Children being baptized, have all things necessary for salvation, and dying before they commit any actual sin, be undoubtedly saved, though they be not Confirmed,</hi> which Assertion, if understood of all Infants, even of heathen, is certainly false; and if onely of the Infants of Christians, is doubtfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the judgement of many learned Protestants, and will give lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle satisfaction to us or others; some more we might name, which for brevities sake we omit: All which considered we altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of that happy success which Thousands hope and wait for from this his Majesties Commission; unless God shall incline your hearts for the Peace and Union of the Nation to a more considerable and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory alteration of the Liturgie.

As to our own Consciences if we thought not the Common Prayer Book to be guilty of the general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faults which we have laid open to you, we durst not have found fault with it; And while we took it to be a defective, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and inconvenient mode of worship, it would be our sin to use it of choyce while we may prefer a more convenient way, what ever we ought to do in case of necessity when we must worship God inconveniently or not at all.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39600:26"/> instead of prescribing them a Forme of Divine Services for their Unity and Concord, doe exhort them to use their Gifts and liberties aright, and speak the same thing for matter, avoiding▪ Disagreements, though they used not the same words. 3. <hi>Just.

It is ordinary with those of the contrary Judgement, to tell us that the extraordinary Gifts of the Primitive Christians, were the reason why the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e were no prescribed forms in those times, and that such Liturgies came in upon the ceasing of those Gifts: And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. describeth a way of publick worshipping, unlike to prescript forms of Liturgy: So that the matter of Fact is proved and confessed. And then how fairly the words of the Apostles, exhorting them [to speak the same thing] are used to prove that he would have them use the same forms or Liturgy; we shall not tell you by any provoking aggravations of such abuse of Scripture. And indeed for all the miraculous Gifts of those times, if prescript forms had been judged by the Apostles to be the fittest means for the Concord of the Churches, it is most probable they would have prescribed such: Considering 1. That the said miraculous Gifts were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and belonged not to all, nor to any at all times, and therefore could not suffice for the ordinary publick Worship. 2. And those Gifts began even betimes to be abused, and need the Apostles Canons for their regulation, which he giveth them in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. without a prescript Liturgy. 3. Because even then divisions had made not only an entrance, but an unhappy progress in the Churches, to cure which the Apostle exhorts them oft to Unanimity and Concord, without exhorting them to read the same or any Common-Prayer-book. 4. Because that the Apostles knew that perillous times would come, in which men would have itching ears, and would have heaps of Teachers, and would be self-willed, and unruly, and divisions, and offences, and heresies would encrease: And <hi>Ergo,</hi> as upon such fore-sight they indited the holy Scriptures to keep the Church in all generations, from error and divisions in points of Doctrine, so the same reason and care would have moved them to do the same to keep the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in unity in point of Worship, if indeed they had taken prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39600:27"/> forms to be needfull to such an unity: they knew that after departure the Church would never have the like advantage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, authorized, and enabled for delivering the universal Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If they had pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

All Churches and Countries might had one Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as they have one Scripture, and so have all spoke the same things. 4. All ages would have had the same without innovation, (in all the parts that require not alteration) whereas now on the contrary, 1. Our Liturgies being the writings of fallible men, are lyable to error, and we have cause to fear subscribing to them, as having nothing contrary to the word of God. 2.

And they may scruple whether such making themselves the Governours of their Brethren, make not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves indeed of a different order or office, and so encroach not on the authority of Christ, who only maketh officers purely Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, and whether it be no disloyalty to Christ to own such offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. 3. And among those Divines that are for a threefold Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, (besides that of Presbyters, who are <hi>Episcopi Gregis</hi>) viz. generall unfixed Bishops, like the Evangelists or Apostles, (in their measure and the fixed Bishops of Parochial Churches, that have P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>esbyters to assist them, to whom they do preside, and also the Presidents of larger Synods) yet is it a matter of very great doubt, whether a fixed Diocesan being the Pastour of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Churches, having none under him, that hath the power of Jurisdiction or Ordination, be indeed a Governour of Christs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment or approbation, and whether Christ will give us any more thanks for owning them as such, then the King will give us for owning an Usurper. Humility alone will not seem to subject these men to such a Government. 4. And though their coereive Magistratical power be easily submitted to, as being from the King (how unfit Subjects soever Church men are of such a power) yet he that knoweth his superiours best, doth honour God more, and supposeth God more infallible then man, and will feel himself most indispensibly bound by Gods commands, and bound not to obey man against the Lord. And whereas there is much said against the peoples taking on them to judge of the lawfulinesse of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them by superiours, we adde, 5. That humble men may believe that their superiours are fallible; that it is no impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to command things that God forbids, that in such Cases, if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39600:29"/> we have sufficient means to discern the sinfulnesse of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, we must make use of them, and must obey God rather then men; that when the Apostles acted according to such a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19. and <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Witnesses <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. and 3. they all exercised a judgement of discerning upon the matter of their superiours commands; that not to do so at all, is to make Subjects Brutes, and so no Subjects, because not rational free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, or to make all Governours to be Gods; and lastly, that it will not save us from Hell, nor justifie us at Judgement for sinning against God, to say that superiours commanded us, nor will it prove all the Martyrs to be sinners and condemned, because they judged of their superiours commands, and disobeyed them. All which we say to shew the insufficiency of the Remedy, here by you propounded, (the humility of Inseriours) unlesse you will also adde your help, without obedience there is no order or lasting concord to be expected: And by abasing the eternal God, so far as to set him and his Laws below a Creature, under pretence of obedience to the Creature, no good can be expected, because no peace with Heaven, without which, peace with men is but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy hastning each party to Destruction: And therefore abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obedience must be given only to God the absolute Soveraign. In all this we suppose that we are all agreed: And therefore, 6. and lastly, we must say that the way to make us think the Bishops to be so wise, and carefull Guides, and Fathers to us, is not for them to seem wiser then the Apostles, and make those things of standing necessity to the Churches unity, which the Apostles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made so, nor to forbid all to preach the Gosple, or to hold Communion with the Church, that dare not conform to things unnecessary. Love and tendernesse are not used to expresse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by hurting and destroying men for nothing; And to silence and reject from Church Communion for a Ceremony, and in the mean time to perswade men that they love them, is but to stab or famish all the sick person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> To this passage we humbly crave your consideration of these Answers, 1. We have not only said, that sober pious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons scruple the Liturgy) but we have opened to you those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and disorders, and corruptions, which must needs make the imposing of it, unlawfull, when God might be more fitly served. 2. It is strange, that you must see it first evidently proved unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for men to joyn with the Liturgy (you mean, we suppose, to joyn with you in the using of it, or when you use it,) before you will see reason to alter any thing in it; what if it be only proved unlawfull for you to impose it, though not for others to joyn with you when you do impose it, is this no reason to alter it? should you not have some care to avoid sin your selves, as well as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve others from it? An inconvenient mode of Worship is a sin in the Imposer, and in the Chooser, and voluntary User, that might offer God better, and will not, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13, 14. And yet it may not be only lawfull, but a duty to him that by violence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to offer up that or none. And yet we suppose the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers should see cause to make an Alteration. If you lived where you must receive the Lords Supper Sitting, or not at all, its like you would be of this mind your selves. 3. Why should it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led [a bare pretence of Scruple,] as if you search'd the Hearts, and knew (not only that they are upon mistake, but) that they are not real, when the Persons not only professe them real, but are willing to use all just means that tend to their satisfaction, they study, read, pray, and will be glad of Conference with you, at any time, upon equal termes, if they may be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves believed. 4. Even groundlesse scruples about the matter of an unnecessary Law, which hath that which to the weak both is and will be an appearance of evil, may be sufficient to make it the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And themselves affirm it to be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, but a thing indifferent, while they exclude all higher institutions from the power of the Church. 3. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it lawfull to serve God without this Liturgy, without which he was served by other Churches above 1460. years, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he is now served by other Churches, when the contrary minded doubt whether with it he be lawfully ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 4 Those that desire the alteration, desire no more than to serve God as the Churches did in the dayes of the Apostles, that had their most infallible conduct. 5. And they offer also such Formes as are more unquestionable as to their Congruency to the word of God, and to the nature of the several pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts of worship. 6. And yet though they desire the surest concord and an universal
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39600:31"/> Reformation) they desire not to impose on others what they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but can thankfully accept a Liberty to use what is to their own Consciences most unquestionably safe, while other men use that which they like better. So that set all this together, with the consideration of the necessity of the preaching the Word, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that is hereupon denyed, and you may see it proved, That so have such a Litu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gy so altered, that is confessed alterable, for to desirable an end, for the use only of those that cannot well use it, without urging others to any thing that they do themselves account unlawfull, cannot be a matter of just offence to the generality of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Children of the Church, nor to any one. And as to the reason given, it is apparently none. For 1. of those that scruple the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse of it, there are many that will not peremptorily affirm it unlawfull, and condemn all that use it, but they dare not use it doubtingly themselves. 2. When our Papers were before you, we think it not just that you should say that it's here desired to be altered, on the pretence that it is a direct cause of Schisme and a superstitious usage: Have we any such expressions? if we have, let them be recited: If not, it is hard that this should even by you be thus affirmed as is said by us, which we have not said: We have said [that the Ceremonies have been the Fountain of much Evil, occasioning divisions, but not what you charge as to have said in words or sense. 3. And may not you alter them without approving, or seeming to approve the reason upon which the alteration is desired, when you have so great store of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reasons? The King in his Declaration is far enough from seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to own the Charge against the things which he was pleased gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to alter so far as is there exprest.

By this reason of yours he is by other men in such a Case necessitated to sin▪ For if he settle those things which some count necessary, he seems to approve of their opinion, that they are necessary: If he take them down when others call them sinfull, he seems to own their charge of the sinfulnesse. But indeed he needeth not to do either, he may take them down or leave them indifferent, professedly for unity and peace, and professedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39600:31"/> the Errours on both sides. We are sorry if any did esteem these Formes and Ceremonies any better than mutable indifferent modes and circumstances of Worship: and did hazard estate or life for them as any otherwise esteemed: And we are sorry, that by our Divisions the Adversary of Peace hath gotten so great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against us, as that the Argument against necessary charitable forbearance is fetch'd from the interest of the reputation of the contending Parties, that things may not be abated to others which you confesse are indifferent and alterable, and which many of them durst not use, though to save their lives. And this because it will make them thought the pious, tender Conscienc'd men, And make others thought worse of. But with whom will it have these effects? those that you call the generality of the sober loyal Children of the Church will think never the worse of themselves, because others have liberty to live by them, without these things. And the rest, whose liberties you deny, will think rather the worse of you, than the better, for denying them their libertie in the worshipping of God. You undoubtedly argue here against the interest of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you stand for, your Prefaces to your Indulgencies and your open Professions; and (if you will needs have it so) your own Practises, will tell the World loud enough, that the things which you adhered to with so great hazards are still lawfull in your Judgement, and it will be your honour, and adde to your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to abate them to others, when it is in your power to be more severe. And if you refuse it, their sufferings will tell the World loud enough, that for their parts they still take them to be things unlawfull.

If by [in the Church] you mean [not by the Church] but by any part in the Church] how shall we know that they did well. And if by [the generality] you mean not All, but the Greater part, you undertake the proof of that which is not easie to be proved.

He that hath but a weak Faith (though not a full trust) must come to have it strengthened: And he that hath an unquiet Conscience must come to receive that mercy which may quiet it.

But we thankfully accept of your following words, [and if the contrary can be proved we wish it out of the Liturgy] which we intreat you to perform, and impartially receive our proofs.

And we must beseech you, if the Churches Judgement or Practise must be urged, that you would do us the justice, as to imitate the Antient Churches in your sense of the quality, and the mode and measure of using, and imposing things, as well as in the materials used, and imposed. Consider not only [whether you find such things received by the Antient Churches,] but also consider how they were received, esteemed, and used,] whether as necessary or indifferent, as points of Faith or doubtfull Opinions, whether forced on others, or left to their free choyce; If you find, that the generality of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Churches received the White Garment after Baptisme, and the tasting of Milk and Honey as Ceremonies freely, though generally used, you should not therefore force men to use them; If you find, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or of Angels corporeity was generally received as an Opinion, it will not warrant you to receive either of them as a certain necessary truth. If you find, that the General Councells forbad Kneeling in any Adoration on the Lords dayes, but without force against Dissenters, you may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39600:33"/> not go deny the Sacrament to all that kneel, nor yet forbid them to kneel in praying. So if you find some little parcels of our Liturgie, or some of our Ceremonies used as things indifferent, left to choice, forced upon none, but one Church differing from another in such usages or observances, this will not warrant you to use the same things as necessary to order, unity, or peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If it be said [that a Ministers work is not to show his parts] we answer but his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial worke is, to show men their sins, and to preach the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Mysteries of the Gospel, to help men to search, and understand the Scriptures, and to search, and to know their hearts, and to know God in Christ, and to hope for the glory that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: and fervently to pray for the successe of his endeavours, and the blessings of the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A Physitians work is not to shew his parts ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, but it is to do that for the cure of diseases which without parts he cannot do, and in the exercise of his parts, on which the issue much depends, to save mens lives. The ostentation of his good works, is not the work of a good Christian: and yet he must so let his light shine before men, that they may see his good works, and glorifie God. And undeniable experience tells us, that God ordinarily proportioneth the successe and blessing, to the skill, and holinesse and diligence of the Instruments, and blesseth not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of ignorant, ungodly Drones, as he doth the labours of able faithfull Ministers.

And we must adde that whatsoever can be expected duly to affect the heart, must keep the intellect, and all the faculties awake in diligent attention, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise: And in the use of a form, which we have frequently heard and read, the faculties are not so necessitated and urged to attention, and serious exercise, as they be when from our own understanding we are set about the natural work of representing to others what we discern and feel. Mans mind is naturally sloathfull, and will take its ease, and remit its seriousnesse longer then it is urged by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39600:35"/> necessity, or drawn out by delight, when we know before hand, that we have no more to do, but read a Prayer, or Homily, we shall ordinarily be in danger of letting our minds go another way, and think of other matters, and be sencelesse of the work in hand. Though he is but an Hypocrite that is carried on by no greater motive then mans observation, and approbation; yet is it a help not to be despised, when even a necessity of avoiding just shame with men, shall necessarily awake our invention, and all our faculties to the work, and be a concurrent help with spiritual motives. And common experience tells us, that the best are apt to loose a great deal of their affection, by the constant use of the same words or forms; Let the same Sermon be preached an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times over, and try whether an hundred for one will not be much lesse moved by it, then they were at fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And man must cease to be man, or to be mortal, before it will be otherwise; so that the nature of the thing, and the common experience of our own dispositions, and of the effect on others, assureth us, that understanding serious Godlinesse, is like to be extinguished, if only forms be allowed in the Church, on pretence of extinguishing errors and divisions: And though we have concurred to offer you our more corrected Nepenthes, yet must we before God and men, protest against the dose of Opium which you here prescribe or wish for, as that which plainly tendeth cure the disease by the extinguishing of life, and to unite us all in a dead Religion.

The words [their worship] seem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that singing Psalmes is part (of our Worship) and not of yours, we hope you disown it not; for our parts we are not ashamed of it, your distinction between <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Psalmes, as if the meter allowed by Authority to be sung in Churches, made them to be no more <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes, seemeth to us a very hard saying. If it be because it is a Translation, then the prose should be none of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes neither, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Translation be the Scripture. If it be because it is in meter, then the exactest Translation in meter should be none of the Scripture; If because its done imperfectly, then the old Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Bible, used by the Common Prayer Book should not be Scripture. As to your reason for the supposed priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 1. Scripture examples telling us, that the People had more part in the Psalmes, than in the Prayers or Readings, satisfie us, that God and his Church then saw a disparity of Reason. 2. Common observation tells us, that there is more order and lesse hinderance of Edification in the Peoples Singing, than in their Reading, and Praying together vocally.</p>

It saith also [and when they be gathered together (forasmuch as they be an Assembly of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all be not governed with the Spirit and word of God) they may erre, and sometimes have erred, even in things perteyning unto God; therefore things ordained by them, as necessary to Salvation, have neither strength nor au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, unlesse it may be declared that they be taken out of the Holy Scriptures;] And if they may erre in things perteyning unto God, and ordained by them as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation] much more in lesser things. And are we contentious if we erre not with them? Our 39.

If you cite the Apocripha as you do other humane writings, or read them as Homilies, (when and where there is reason to read such) we speak not against it,) to say that the people are secured by the Churches calling them Apocripha, is of no force, till experience be proved to be dis-regardable, and till you have proved that the Ministers is to tell the people at the reading of every such Chapter that it is but Apocriphal, and that the people all understand Greek so well as to know what Apocripha signifieth. The more sacred and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable are these Dictates of the holy Ghost recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the greater is the sin, by reading the Apocripha, without sufficient distinction to make the people believe that the writings of man are the Revelation and Laws of God; And also we speak against the reading of the Apocripha, as it excludeth much of the Canonical Scriptures, and taketh in such Books in their stead, as are commonly reputed fabulous. By this much you may see how you lost your Answer by mistaking us, and how much you will sin against God, and the Church, by denying our desire.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39600:47"/> your speech is directed to some other (we know not whom) concerning us, your reason is that which is our reason to the contrary, you say (The Priest standing at the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seems to give us an Invitation to the holy Communion, <hi>&amp;c</hi>) what when there is no Sacrament by himself or us intended? no warning of any given? no Bread and Wine prepared? Be not deceived, God is not mocked. Therefore we desire that there may be no such service at the Table when no Communion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, because we would not have such grosse dissimulation used in so holy things, as thereby to seem (as you say) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Guests when the Feast is not prepared, and if they came we would turn them empty away. Indeed if it were to be a private Mass, and the Priest were to receive alone for want of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and it were really desired that the people should come, it were another matter; Moreover there is no Rubrick requiring this service at the Table.</p>

All is not false Doctrine that crosseth mens private Opinions, which you seem here to obtrude upon us. We know that the Papists (and perhaps some others) hold that all the baptised are delivered from the Guilt of Original sin; But (as they are in the dark, and disagreed in the Explication of it) so we have more reason to incline to either of the ordinary Opinions of the Protestants, than to this of theirs, 3. Some learned Protestants hold that visibly all the baptised are Church members; pardoned and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which is but that they are probably justified indeed, and are to be used by the Church (upon a Judgment of Charity) as those that are really justified. But that we have indeed no certainty that they are so; God keeping that as a secret to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self concerning Individuals, till by actual Faith and Repentance, it be manifest to themselves. Another Opinion of many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants is, that all persons that are Children of the Promise, or that have the conditions of pardon and Justification in the Covenant mentioned, are to receive that pardon by Baptisme: and all such are pardoned, and certainly in a state of Justification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereupon: and that the promise of pardon is made to the Faithful and to their seed: and therefore that all the Faithful and their seed in Infancy have this pardon given them by the promise; and solemnly delivered them, and sealed to them by Baptisme, which investeth them in the benefits of the Covenant▪
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39600:52"/> But withall that first, the professed Infidel and his seed as such, are not the Children of the promise, and therefore if the Parnet I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That the Hypocrite that is not a true believer at the heart, though he professe it, hath no pardon by Baptisme before God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not an heir of the promise, nor yet any Infant of his as such: But though such are not pardoned, the Church that judgeth by profession, taking Professors fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Believers, must accordingly use them &amp; their seed, 3. But though the Church judge thus cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably of each Professor in particular, till his hypocrisy be detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet doth it understand that hypocrites there are, &amp; still will be in the Church, though we know them not by name.

We have less reason to take this Doctrine for false, then that which pronounceth certain pardon, and salvation to all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised Infants whatsoever: And were we of their judgment, we should think it the most charitable Act in the world to take the Infants of Heathens, and baptise them; And if any should then dispatch them all to prevent their lapse, they were all certainly saved. We hope by (some reliques) you mean that which is truly and properly sin. For our parts we believe according to the ninth Article, that Originall sin standeth in the Corruption of the nature of every man, whereby man is far gone from Original righteousnesse, and inclined to evil; And that this infection of nature doth remain in the Regenerate; And though there is no Condemnation for them that believe and are baptised, yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupisence and Lust, hath of it self the nature of sin.) you say, (The Church acknowledgeth such desires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Devices, and Desires are Actual sins and not Original, which consisteth in privation, and corrupt inclination: The next words (<hi>There is no health in us</hi>) it seems the Translators that put it into the Liturgy mis-understood; But however you seem here plainly by your mis-interpretation to mis-understand it. <hi>Nulla salus in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> is spoken actively and not possessively or passively, the plain sence is, that there is no help deliverance and salvation in our selves: we cannot help our selves out of this misery, but must

That God hath not given a power only, but a command also of imposing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should be truly decent, and becomming his publick Service,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>After St,</hi> Paul <hi>had ordered some particular Rules for Praying, Praising, Prophesying,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he concludes with this general Canon,</hi> Let all things be done <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Repl.</hi> As to your first rule we answer. 1. It is one thing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in general, that all b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:39600:54"/> himself hath imposed by his Apostle: And its another thing to impose in particular, that this or that be used, as decent and orderly. Concerning this we adde, it is in the Text said, Let it be done, but not let it be imposed, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ary cautions and limitations afterward laid down. But 1. that if any U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urpers will pretend a power from Christ, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such things on the Church, though the things be lawful, we must take heed how we acknowledge an usurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st power may impose them but to just ends, as the preservation and successe of the modified Worship, or Ordinances. And if they really conduce not to those ends, they sin in imposing them. 3. Yet the Subjects are bound to obey a true Authority in such impositions, where the matter belongs to the Cognizance, and Office of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and where the mistake is not so great, as to bring great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mischiefs to the Church, than the suspending of our active obedience would do. 4. But if these things be determined under p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Or if under the names of things decent, and of order, men will meddle wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Where Governours may command at set times, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Then if the King, Parliament, and Convocation should change these Ceremonies, it seems you would take your selves bound to retain them; For you say you must not worship God undecently: But that they may be changed by Authority our Articles determine, and therefore Charity may well require the Magistrate to change them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wrong to the worship of God. 3. We appeal to the common judgment of the Impartial, whether in the nature of the thing, there be any thing that tells them, that it is undecent, to pray without a Surplice in the reading place, and not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to pray without in the Pulpit; And that it is undecent to baptise without crossing, and not to receive the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per without: And that it is undecent for the Receiver to take the Lords Supper without kneeling, and not for the Minister to give it him standing that prayeth in the delivery.</p>

Signs are either arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expressions, of a mans own mind in a matter, where he is let free, or they are covenanting signs between us and God in the Covenant of Grace, to work Grace on us as moral causes, and to engage us Sacramentally to him; such we conceive the Cross in Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The minor is proved thus, If it belong to the universal head, or Ruler of the Church as such, then it belongs to the power proper to Christ (for we are ready to prove there is none under him, no universal head or ruler personally, or collectively and civilly one,) But, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> If in the reason of it, it should be the matter of an universal Law, if of any, then it should be the work of the universal Lawgiver, if any: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If in the reason of it, it be equally usefull to the Church universal as to any particular Church or age, then it should according to the reason of it, be the matter of an universal Law, if of any: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it hath the same aptitude, to engage us to a duty of universal necessity, and hath no reason proper to this age or place for it, but common to all. Moreover it is no where committed to the power or care of man, <hi>ergo</hi> it is proper to the care and power of Christ, no Text is shewed that giveth man power in such things: To doe all things decently and orderly, and to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no giving of power on that pretence to make new Covenanting dedicating signes, to do Gods work decently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not to make more such of our own heads: It is but the right modifying of the work already set us. And to do all decently, orderly, and to edification, was a duty in <hi>Moses</hi> time, when yet such things as these in question might not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by any but God: (when we say by God, we mean by his inspired In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and when we say by Christ, we mean by his inspired Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:) If we should make Laws that every one is publickly to tast Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and Gall, as a sign that we are not ashamed of, but resolved through all flesh displeasing difficulties to follow Christ, that died so, and thus to engage, and dedicate our selves to him, this were to do more, then to do all things decently, and orderly which he appointed: If milk were to be publickly sucked or drunk, by all in profession, that we will feed on the sincere milk of his word, and so dedicate us to him by Covenant, or
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39600:59"/> if we were to put on an Helmet, and other Armour in token that we will be his Souldiers to the death, and manfully fight under, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These engagements by such publick signs, are Sacraments in the sense, as the word was used of old, when it signified a Souldiers solemn lysting or Covenanting with his Commander. Thus by distinguishing decent and orderly modes, and Circumstances necessary <hi>in genere,</hi> from new ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, even solemn dedicating, covenanting or such like mistical signs, we have shewed you what we grant, and where you fail, and what is indeed a wrong to Christ, and an accusation of his Laws and what not: and how unjust your following accusation of us is: (who never yet told you, we would be accounted the best Christians; but to desire to please Christ as near as we can, is not blame worthy.) Abundance of things of lesser moment then these are commanded by God in the Law, to which he added that sanction <hi>Deut. 12. 32. what ever things I command thee,</hi> &amp;c. And we conceive that the words [as my father sent me so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] had some what proper to the extraordinary mission: and if he hear not the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is neither spoken of a Church universal, nor of Magistrates making Laws for such Ceremonies, or signes. But if he hear not the Church, with which he was in Communion, and which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth him for his sin, let the Church reject him from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                     <p>Sect. 10. A. 3. <hi>The command for decent Ceremonies may still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church notwithstanding the 12. of</hi> Deut. <hi>and so it may too for all the exceptions taken against them, by sundry learned, pious, and Orthodox persons who have judged them, they say, unwarantable, And if Laws may be abrogated assoone as those that list not to obey will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against them, the world must run into confusion. But those that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept are weak brethren, whom by Christs precept and example we must not offend. If by weak we understand ignorant, they would take it ill to be so accounted, and it is their own fault if they be, there having been much written, as may satisfy any that have a mind to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: And as King James of blessed memory said at Hampton-Court. If after so many years preaching of the Gospel, there be any yet unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, I doubt it proceeds rather out of stubborness of opinion, then out of tenderness of conscience, If by tenderness of conscience they mean, a fearfulness to sin, this would make them most easy to be satisfied, because most fearfull to disobey superiours. But suppose there be any so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, as not satisfied with what hath been written, the Church may still without sin urge her command for these decent Ceremonies, and not be guilty of offending her weak brother, for since the scandal is taken

If you should but command your servant to do what you bid him decently and orderly, you would think he mistook you, if upon that pretence he would do any other work, which he could but say tended to the decency of yours. And we would gladly hear what you can think your selves is forbidden in <hi>Deut.</hi> if not such humane ordinances? and why you forbear giving the truer sense of the Text. It is a sad case with the poore Church, when Gods wisdome, that made a few &amp; necessary things the matter of his Churches concord, is no more valued; But we will be wiser, and when the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Church that hath been torn into pieces 1400. years, by mens inventions, and needless usages, and impositions is yet of no more force with us that come after them, but what ever can be said or done, or seene, we will still make Laws, that all men shall be <hi>tantum non,</hi> unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened and damned, (that is cast out of the Ministry or Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) that will not wear this or that or bow thus or thus, or look this way or that way, or say this word or that word; and when we have laid such a needless snare, we will uncharitably cry out, the world will be brought into confusion, because men that list not to obey, vvould have the Lavvs abrogated. Where hath Christ set you to make such Lavvs? is it not vvork enough for us and you to obey the Lavvs that he hath made? vvhy made he none for postures, and vestures and vvords, and teaching signes of this nature, if he vvould have had them? If he had not told us that there is one Lavvgiver, one Lord, and that his vvord is able to make us vvise unto Salvation, and that he would lay noe greater burden on us, then necessary things, and would not have us despise or judge each other on such occasions: If he had but told us, that he left any officers after his inspired Apostles, for the making of Ceremonies or new Laws of vvorship, or teaching engaging signes for the Church, vve vvould as gladly understand and obey his vvill in these things as you, vvhat hurt is it to us, to use a Crosse or other Ceremony, if it vvere not for fear of disobeying God; Enforce Gods Lavvs upon us zealously as you vvill, and see if vve vvill disobey. But that the vvorld shall run into
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39600:60"/> confusion, rather then we shall have leave to serve God as <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did, without crossing surplices and kneeling at the Sacrament, and then that we shall be reproached as the cause of all by our disobedience, God hath told the world by his word, and will tell them by his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that this is not his way to unity and peace. As to the Argument from your brethrens weakness we say first, it is not your strength to sleight it or them: nor is it their weakness that they are willing to be esteemed weak. The Apostle called those weak that placed a necessity in indifferent things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and not those that understood their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency; But the truth is the nature of things indifferent, is not vvell understood by all on either side, some may think evil of some things that deserve it not, and in this they are vveak though in other matters they may be strong.

But how prove you it, we would take it ill, to be our selves or have those we speake of accounted ignorant, in such things as these use us no worse then the ignorant should be used: and till you would turne a man out of the Ministry, or Church for being ignorant of the nature of a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (which never was in his Creed, the Decalogue or Scripture) deale not so by us, that would be wiser if we knew how. That all our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is our own fault we deny not, but it is an expresse of confidence, and uncharitablenesse to tell us, that there is so very much written as may satisfie any man that hath a minde to be satisfied, and when we professe in his sight that knoweth the hearts, that we have a mind to be satisfied, and would know the truth at what rate soever if we knew how, what would you have us doe that we doe not, to be satisfied? doe we not read as much for Ceremonies, as the dissenters use to doe against them? Many Books against them are yet unanswered, and we never shunned any publick, or private conference with any of you, and such reasonings as these are not like to convince us. If you will be the jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of your brethrens hearts, and say it is not tendernesse of Conscience, but stubbornnesse, we shall refer that to the day when your hearts, and ours, shall all be opened. Must none be tender conscienc't that dare not venture to obey you in such things? when you may with undoubted safety forbear the imposing of your Ceremonies, and so forbear the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting out of your brethren, if you will not, who shews lesse tendernesse of Conscience? That the scandall is taken and not given, is still the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39600:60"/> thing in question, as to many things: and if it were no just occasion of offence, you ought not to lay that which anothers weakness will turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a stumbling block unnecessarily before them; if the Apostles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be good <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. the Church may not urge unlawful things, nor things meerly lawful upon such penalties as will exclude things necessary. If an idle word be to be accounted for, an idle Law is not laudable, much lesse when all men must be excluded the Ministry, or communion that scruple it: when yet a man may be a prophane swearer, for 12 pence an oath, and may swear an 100. times before he payes that 12 pence. A Papist shall pay 12. pence for not coming to Church, and a Protestant be thrust out of your Communion, for not kneeling at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and a Minister suspended, imprisoned, undone for not crossing a child or wearing a Surplice, may Magistrates, or the Church thus urge their commands? can any thing be spoken plainer, then the Scripture speaks against this course? and would you make the world believe that the brethren that do not all that you bid them are so unreasonably and obstinately scrupulous, as to have no matter of offence, but what they lay before themselves? when they have the practice of the Apostles, and the custome of the primitive Church, for many hundred years against you, and this called by them an Apostolical tradition, and decreed by the most uncharitable Councils that ever were. If you had but one of these (the decree of a General Council, or practise of all the purest Churches alone) for one of your Ceremonies, you would think him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, that so reproached you for pretending conscience.</p>

Secondly, nor of any thing of decency or significancy to serve in the Church. To the first, we have oft told you, that which is undenyable; first, that <hi>Paul</hi> was a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Church himself, that had no superiour to controule him.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39600:61"/> If you say that he then wrote not as a Governour, we answer, yes: Fo he wrote as an Apostle, and wrote the Epistle that was to be a standing Law or Canon to them: If this be not an act of his Office, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, there was none such; And then you must say the like of all the rest of the Epistles. 2ly. Moreover as <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, excludeth all such impositions, so he wrote to all the resident Pastours that were at <hi>Rome,</hi> for he wrote to the whole Church: and therefore these commands extend to the Governours, that they make not such things the matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or Censures, or any uncharitable course, but bear with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in them, will you call men obstinate self offenders that differ from you, when you haue no better answers then these, to the plain decisions of the Holy Ghost? What we speak of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 15. we speak also of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. And 3ly. it is to the Rulers of the Church, that we are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is they that answer us: and shall the Rulers say [if it were not a thing commanded we might bear with you] when it is themselves that command them ecclesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yea <hi>à fortiori,</hi> it layeth a heavier charge on such Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, then others: If it be so heynous a sin as <hi>Paul</hi> maketh it, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or despise one another, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And the difference is wholly to the advantage of our cause: For those that <hi>Paul</hi> spake to were not come so high as to go about to force others to do as they did: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to despise them for not doing it. 2. And therefore to your second Reason we answer. 1. If the things had been different, yet so was <hi>Pauls</hi> injunction different from our Request; For <hi>Paul</hi> goeth so high as to command them to deny their own liberty in not eating lawfull meats themselves, least they offend and hurt their brethren, whereas we are now desiring you, that you would not force others to do that which they take to be a sin, and that with penalties that fall heavier on the Church then on them, They had on both sides fairer pretences then you have: The Cases before us to be compared are four; The Case of the Refusers of meats, and observers of dayes then: The Case of the users of those meats and non-observers of those dayes; The Case of our Imposers and the Case of non Conformist; The pretence of their Refusers of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:39600:61"/> meats had in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. was that being offered to Idols, they thought it made them partakers of the Idolatry, &amp; so they sinn'd through weakness in being offended at others, and censuring them that used their liberty: And had they not here a fairer pretence, for their offence and censures, then you for your impositions? you cannot shevv half so great an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of good in the things commanded, as they could do of evil in the things for vvhich they vvere offended. And the offended censurer in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. had this pretence that the thing vvas forbidden in Gods ovvn Lavv, even the meats, which he refused, and the dayes commanded which he observed: And he knew not that the Law in these matters of order &amp; Ceremony was abrogated (which <hi>Peter</hi> was ignorant of, when he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to eat things common and unclean.)

To tell us then that <hi>Paul</hi> spake of things [not decent, and significant] is [pardon our plainness] to say much lesse then nothing: For it vvas not against imposing that <hi>Paul</hi> spake, but using, and not using, censuring, and despising; And their Arguments were (sutable to their cause) of another kind of moment, then decency, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency, significancy or insignificancy, even from supposed Idolatry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Gods Law, and complying with the Jews and Hereticks, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the Law, and casting away the liberties purchased by Christ even in their private eating, &amp; drinking. To be no more tedious now, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer in any way convenient to try out with that Reverend brother that so confidently asserted the disparity of the Cases, and to prove that these Scriptures, most plainly condemn your impositions now in question, though we should have thought that one impartial reading of them might▪

You require not the Adult that are baptized, to recieve that Seal or Sacrament kneeling, 3ly. When kneeling at prayers was in use, in the Apostles times, yet kneeling in the reception of the Sacrament was not, 4ly. Why can you so lightly put of both the practice, and Cannons of the Church in this more then in other such things? However you cannot here deny <hi>de facto</hi> but that kneeling on the Lords dayes in the receiving of the Sacrament was for many hundred years of the purer times of the Church disused and condemned; And why do you not tell us what other general Council repealed this, that we may see whether it be such as we are any way bound by? When you say [the Church may vary in such indifferent things.] First, If kneeling or standing at prayer be an indifferint thing, then so are they at this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. 2ly. Then you follow the changes, and we the old pattern. 3ly. Then the Cannons of general Councils, and customes pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be from Apostolical tradition may be changed. 4ly. What is it that you call the Church, that changeth or may change these? A Council or a popular custome? Bring us not under a forraign power. 5ly. The thing then being so indifferent and changeable, you may change it if you please for ends that are not indifferent. 6ly. And if now the Ministers may pray standing, why may not the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive standing. 7ly. When you say that to sit was never the use of the best times you deny the Apostles and primitive times to be the best, as to the exten of the Church they were not the best but as to purity of administrations they were.</p>

And would it not have been so with the prayers, or would they have been altogether unmentioned, if they also had been there prescribed to, and used by the Church, as the Psalmes were? would Christ &amp; his Apostles even where they were purposely giving rules for prayer and correcting its abuse as <hi>Matth. 6. 1 Cor. 14, &amp;c.</hi> have never mentioned any forms but the Lords prayer, if they had appointed such, or desired such to be imposed, and observed? These things are incredible to us when we most impartially consider them, for our own parts as we think it uncharirable to forbid the use of Spectacles to them that have weak eyes, or of Crutches to them that have weak Limbs, and as uncharitable to undo all that will not use them, whether they need them or not, so we can think no better of them, that will suffer none to use such forms, that need them, or that will suffer none to pray but in the words of other mens prescribing, though they are at least, as able as the prescribers.

He saith of <hi>Victor,</hi> and <hi>Policarp</hi> that [they deservedly judged it frivolous, or absur'd that those should be separated on the account of a custome, that consented in the principal heads of Religion: For you cannot find the same traditions in all things alike, in all Churches though they agree among themselves] and instancing in some Countryes, where there is but one Bishop in many Cities, and in others Bishops are ordained in the villages.] After many other instances, he addes [that they use not the same prayers, singings or readings, nor observe the same time of using them.] And what Liturgy was imposed upon <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperours, or what Bishops or Synods, were then the makers of Lyturgies, when he himself made publick prayers for himself and auditory, and for his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; <hi>Euseb. de vit. Constantini, l. 4. c.</hi> 18. 20, &amp;c. But the diversity, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and change of Lyturgies in the Churches under the same Prince are things so well known, as that we may suppose any further proof of it to be needles: In the conclusion therefore we humbly beseech you, that as Antiquity and the custome of the Churches in the first ages, is that which is most commonly, and confidently pleaded against us, that your mistake of Antiquity may not be to our Cost, or paid so dear for as the losse of our Freedome, for the serving of God in the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry to which we are called, we beseech you let us not be silenced or cast out of the Ministry or Church, for not using the Liturgie, Crosse, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, kneeling at the Sacrament, till you have either shewed the world that the practice or Cannons of the Catholick Church have led you the was as doing it, or requiring it to be done. And make not that so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary as to force men to it on such dreadfull terms, which the ancient
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:39600:66"/> Churches used with diversity, and indifferency of liberty, we beseech you shew the world some proof, that the ancient Churches did ever use to force, or require Ministers to subscribe to their Lyturgies, as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them contraly to the word of God, or to swear obedience to their Bishops, before you impose such things on us, while yet you pretend to imitate Antiquity. And have but that moderation towards your brethren, as in suffering, or at death, or judgement you would most appear. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how unpleasing the remembrance of such differences about Ceremonies was to Bp. <hi>Ridley,</hi> as towards Bp. <hi>Hooper</hi> when they were in prison: and how the <hi>Arrians</hi> fury made the Orthodox gladly to go to the Churches of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and meet with them and joyn with them in prayer, and had almost been united with them in the bond of Concord, if the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in a stiffe maintayning of their old customes had not utterly refused it; But yet in other matters they embraced each other with so singular a benevolence and love, that they would willingly have dyed for each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther] as <hi>Socrat.</hi> tells us <hi>Hist. l. 2. c.</hi> 30. And may we not all here see our duty? When <hi>Atticus</hi> was urged to deny to the <hi>Novatians</hi> the Liberty of their meetings within the City, he refused it, because they had suffered for the saith in the <hi>Arrians</hi> persecution, and changed nothing in the faith, though they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It was the much praised saying of <hi>Theodosius</hi> to him that asked him why he put none to death that wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, [I would I could rather make them that are dead alive] <hi>Socrates l. 7. c.</hi> 22. Much more should Christian Bps. be enemies to cruelty, who know that Charity is more essential to Christianity then this, or that form of Liturgy, or Ceremonies. If you think it unsufferable that we should have differences about such things, remember that there will be no perfect unity till there is perfect Charity, and sanctity, and that destroying one another, and consequently destroying Charity is an unhappy way to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that unity is to be held in things necessary, &amp; Liberty in things unnecessary, and Charity in both, remember that it was in a far greater difference, where <hi>Constantine</hi> perswadeth the Christians to mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance by the example of the Philosophers, that suffered differences in abundance of their opinions, <hi>Euseb. de vita Constant. l. 2. c.</hi> 67. And that <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> was made more moderate, and abated his persecution of the Orthodox by the Oration of <hi>Themistius,</hi> who bid him not wonder at the dissentions of Christians, for they were small if compared with the multitude and croud of opinions that are among the heathen Philosophers, as being more then 300. And that God will by this diversity of opinions manifest his glory and make men the more reverence him, who is so hardly

Those that dissent from you in these tolerable Cases cannot change their own opinions; But you can if you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear hurting of your brethren.

And as the good man wept, <hi>Socrat. l. 4. c.</hi> 18. When he saw a woman pompously adorned, because he was not so carefull to please God, as she was to allure men, so we shall confess we ought to weep, that we cannot be more Charitable, &amp; laborious in building up the Church in holiness and peace, then others are by uncharitable courses, to afflict it. And it shall be our hope that whether by their labours, or their sufferings, God will serve and honour himself, by those many faithful servants of his, whom he hath called into his work, and whose cause we plead, and that however they are used they shall not be unuseful to the ends of their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As <hi>Theodoret</hi> observes <hi>Hist. l. 4. c.</hi> 30. that in a Calamitous time, [the Moderatour of the Universe raised up such guides as were sufficient, in so great a fluctuation, and opposed the valour of the Leaders, to the greatness of the enemies incursion, and gave the best remedies in the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est times of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39600:67"/> suffer us quietly to serve God or conscionably to serve you, we shall be the less sollicitious for that part of our task, from which you have power to discharge us. And as <hi>Basil</hi> said to <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour that would have him pray for the life of his Son, [if thou wilt receive the true faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Churches to concord, thy son shall live, which when he refused, he said [the will of God then be done with thy Son,] so we say to you: if you will put on Charity, and promote your brethrens and the Churches peace, God will honour you, and good men will honour you, and your calling will have advantage by it. But if you will do contrary, the will of the Lord be done with your honours. But know that them that honour him, he will honour, and those that despise him shall be lightly esteemed, and that by the course of uncharitable violence, which we deprecate, you will most deeply wound the Cause of your Preheminence even more then its adversaries could have done. And if it be the will of God, that suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home where we have served him, must be our Lot, we doubt not but he will furnish us with strength, and patience, and we shall remember such ensamples as <hi>Ruffin</hi> recordeth, <hi>Hist. l. 2. c.</hi> 3. when a military Bishop sent his Souldiers, to assault 300 scattered Christians, there appeared a strange kind of warfar, when the assaulted offered their necks, saying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Amice, ad quid venisti,</hi> friend why camest thou hither? or if we must be removed from the land of our Nativity, as <hi>Maris</hi> told <hi>Julian</hi> he thank't God that had deprived him of his sight, that he might not see the face of such a man, <hi>Socrat.

But yet we deny this to be any such punishment at all, unless you will call, their non-deliverance a punishment; they are the Children of wrath by nature, and have original Sin; The Covenant of Grace that giveth the saving benefits of Christ, is made to none but the faithful, and their seed, will you call this a punishing them for their Fathers sakes, that God hath extended his Covenant to no more? Their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents infidelity doth but leave them in their original Sin, and misery, and is not further it self imputed to them. If you know of any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or promise of Salvation made to all without condition, or to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, or any other condition or qualification, but that they be the seed of the faithful dedicated to God, you should do well to shew it us, &amp; not so slightly pass things of so great moment, in which you might much help the World out of darkness, if you can make good what you inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; If indeed you mean as you seem to speak, that its uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to punish any Infants for the Parents <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

We fear you will again revive the opinion of the Anabaptists among the people, when they observe that you have no more to say for the Baptizing of the Children of the faithful, then of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, Heathens, and Atheists. To your second Objection we Answer; You will drive many a faithful labourer from the work of Christ, if he may not be in the Ministry, unless he will baptise the Children of Heathens, Infidels, and excommunicate ones, before their Parents do repent: And the first Question is not who shall be the judge; But whether we must be all thus forced. Is not the Question as great, who shall be the judge of the unfitness of Persons for the Lords Supper? And yet there you think it not

We act but as Engines under you, not as men, if we must not use our reason; and we are more miserable then brutes or men, if we must be forced to go against our Consciences, unless you will save us harmless before God: O that in a fair debate you would prove to us that such children as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed are to be baptized, and that the Ministers that baptize them, must not have power to discern who to baptize. But who mean you by the Churches that must present every Infant that Christ may accept them? Is every Infant first in the promise of pardon? (It so, shew us that promise) and then sure God will make good that promise, though Heathen Parents present not their children to him, as (your grounds suppose) if not, then will the sign save those that are not in the promise: But is it the Godfathers that are the Church, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever called them so? And if by the Church you mean the Minister, and by presenting, you meant baptizing them, then any Heathens child that a Minister can catch up and baptize shall be saved, which if it could be proved would perswade us to go hunt for children in <hi>Turkie, Tartary,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> and secretly baptize them in a habit, that should not make us known; but there is more of fancy then chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this; and Christ never invited any to him, but the children of the promise to be thus presented and baptized.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39600:80"/> God will take it off, and using his ordinary meanes. So that it is most evident that this Absolution that Ministers are to perform, can be no other then to pronounce the penitent Believer to be absolved by God according to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants: And if there be no other, should we not speak as intelligibly as we can? Indeed there is more in absolving the excommunicate, for then the Church both judiciously, and executively remitteth the penalty of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication (to which also the Text, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. may have much respect) but the penalty of damnation can be no otherwise remitted by us, then as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. And indeed the thing is of such exceeding weight, that it behoveth us to deal as intelligibly and openly in it, as we can. And therefore we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that you should say (the Condition needs not be expressed, being always necessarily understood,) necessarily do you mean, <hi>necessitate naturali, &amp; irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistibili?</hi> So that all the wicked men in the world cannot chuse but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand us, to speak conditionally?

And doubtless you think not that all men do their duties, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all that they ought to understand: no not in this particular, If you mean that all sick men may be rationally supposed to understand it, this can never be believed by us that are (acquainted personally (and have been) with so many of whom it is not true.

But why must we give the Sacrament to those that have lived in gross ignorance, Infidelity, and prophaneness, and never manifested credibly, that they repent? you say that (whosoever desireth the Sacrament according to the Rubrick, must in charity be presumed to be penitent.) But where hath God commanded or approved so blind and dangerous an act as this, under the name of Charity? the ordinary observations of our lives, is not to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by mens Assertions: we know by sad experience, that there's abundance of the worst of men among us, that are desirous to receive this Sacrament when they are sick, that give no credible evidence of true repentance, but some in the ignorance, and deceit of their hearts, and some as conscious of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:39600:80"/> their impiety, for which they seek any shifting remedy to quiet their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, for the time, are much more eager for this Sacrament in their sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then many better and more penitent persons. And must we judge all these penitent, and give them the Sacrament as such? we must needs profess that we think this Course would not be the least effectual service unto Satan, to deceive poor sinners, and keep them from knowing their misery, and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aright after the true remedy in time, pardon us while we lay together the parts of your Doctrine, as we understand it here delivered, and leave it to your Consideration, what a Church, and what a Ministry it would make. 1. All Infants of any Parents in the world that we can baptize, are undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regenerate, and in a state of life, and shall be saved if they so die. 2. The holy Ghost and forgiveness of sin, being then given them, it is charitably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, that they have not totally lost this, notwithstanding the frailties and slips of their Child-hood, and so when they can say the Catechisme, they are to be confirmed. 3. Being confirmed, they are to be admitted to the Lords Supper. 4. All that marry, and others thrice a year must receive the Lords Supper (though unfit.) 5. The Minister must absolve all the sick, that say they repent: (if we understand you, for we suppose you allow not the Minister to be judge. 6. This Absolution must be absolutely expresly (I absolve thee from all thy sins) without the Condition (if thou repent and believe.) 7. Whosoever desireth the Communion in his sickness must in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be presumed to be penitent, and fit to receive. 8. The Minister must not have power to forbear such baptizing, absolving, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Communion as aforesaid (we now omit what's said of the dead at burial.) And if this be not the ready way to hinder thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, from the necessary knowledge of their unrenewed hearts, and lives, and from true repentance, and from valuing Christ as the Remedy, and from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a necessary preparation for death, and also the way to lay by aboundance of faithful conscionable Ministers that dare not take such a deceiving dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Course, we must confess our selves much mistaken in the nature of mans corruption, and misery, and the use of Gods Ordinances for his recovery.</p>
